# Spruce
Over time, and, especially with the use of AutoPkg, your Munki repo has
probably accumulated some cruft: piles of test pkginfos and out-of-date Chrome
updates, for example. Spruce looks for objects in your repo which have no
current usage, are out of date, or are otherwise "crufty".

## Usage
*This is very much beta!*


```
usage: spruce.py [-h] {name,report,category,recategorize,deprecate,icons} ...

Spruce is a tool for improving the quality of your Munki repo.

positional arguments:
  {name,report,category,recategorize,deprecate,icons}
                        Sub-command help
    name                Output all unique product names present in the Munki
                        all catalog.
    report              Report on unused or misconfigured items in the repo.
    category            List all categories present in the repo, and the count
                        of pkginfo files in each, or show members of a single
                        category..
    recategorize        Recategorize products based on an input plist
                        generated by the prepare command.
    deprecate           Remove unwanted products from a Munki repo. Pkg and
                        pkginfo files will be removed, or optionally can be
                        archived in an archive repo. All products to be
                        completely removed will then have their names removed
                        from all manifests.
    icons               Report on unused icons and optionally remove or
                        archive them.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```

Subcommands have further options, which you can learn about by running Spruce with the -h command, like this: `./spruce.py icons -h`.

Obviously this is a powerful and dangerous tool. You've been warned!
