This plist includes each unique product name sorted by category. As any product
may have multiple pkginfo files, each with a different category assigned, this
list uses the most-used category (ties ignored).

The recategorize function will only affect those products whose names appear in
this list. Therefore, remove any names you do not wish to change.

Move each name to the list for the desired category.

To add a new category, create a new key with the desired category name, with a
list of strings (the product names) as its value.
